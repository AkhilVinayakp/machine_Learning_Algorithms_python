The quick ones don’t pay much, but your employer provides for everything. You start with a borrowed truck, already laden, ready to get on the road.

You will pay for fuel and repairs and will have to drive to the company depot yourself to pick up the cargo. \\nOf course, moving freely in the world, you can come to any cargo depot and \\ntake what’s available on the spot. However, only using Freight Market and plan-ning ahead will win you the best deals around. \\nSave game (3)\\nNo, it’s not a crucial action anymore. It’s just there for convenience. The game \\nis automatically saved for you often, so you don’t have to do it manually at all. \\nAdjust settings (4)\\nAdjust graphics or audio settings, tweak gameplay preferences, or customize \\ncontrols. \\nSwitch to another profile (5) \\nYou can easily switch to another profile from the Personal widget.
